Android BatchStepSensor Sample
===================================

Sample demonstrating how to set up SensorEventListeners for step
detectors and step counters.

Introduction
------------

This sample demonstrates the use of the two step [sensors][1] (step detector and counter) and
sensor batching.

It shows how to register a [SensorEventListener][2] with and without
batching and shows how these events are received.

The Step Detector sensor fires an
event when a step is detected, while the step counter returns the total number of
steps since a listener was first registered for this sensor.

Both sensors only count steps while a listener is registered. This sample only covers the
basic case, where a listener is only registered while the app is running. Likewise,
batched sensors can be used in the background (when the CPU is suspended), which
requires manually flushing the [sensor event][3] queue before it overflows, which is not
covered in this sample.
